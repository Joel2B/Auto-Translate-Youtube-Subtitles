# Auto Translate Youtube Subtitles

This extension replaces the default youtube subtitles with one customized that allows you to select a word and translates it for you.

The extension is fully functional when the youtube page is in English language.

Only tested in chrome and brave.

## Features
* Auto selection translated subtitles
* Auto selection auto-translate subtitles
* Translate a selected word in the subtitles

although youtube already implements these functionalities, I made this extension to practice.

## Installation

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Activate the "Developer mode" option
3. Load the extension in "Load unpacked"
4. (Optional) Go to "details" and activate "Allow in Private"

## Translation

Translations are obtained from google translator and other services (deepl, bing).

By default deepl is used, since google translator has a limit for translating.
